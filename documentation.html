	<p>Tea-Fueled Last.fm Class/Library. This is a simple PHP library that allows you to interact with Last.fm's API.</p>
	<div id="getting_started">
		<h1>Getting started</h1>
		<p>Before you start to use this library, you first need to get an API key from Last.fm. You can get one at <a href="http://www.last.fm/api/account">Last.fm API site</a>. Take note of the API Key.</p>
		<p>Now that you have an API Key, you need to include <em>lastfmclass.php</em> in your PHP page.</p>
<pre>include('lastfmclass.php');</pre>
		<p>After you have the library included, you need to create a new object so you can use the library. To do this, you need to assign lastFM to a variable. When you create this object, you need to pass two options to it, the API Key, and your username.</p>
<pre>$lastfm = new lastFM('APIKEY','username');</pre>
		<p>Now you are ready to start using the Last.fm Library.</p>

		<h1>Making a basic API Calls</h1>
		<p>Now that you have the Last.fm Library stored in an object, you can now make API calls.</p>
		<p>This library does not have support for all of the API calls. To see the calls that are supported you can check the <a href="http://github.com/mloberg/Tea-Fueled-Last.fm-PHP-Class/wiki/API-Methods">Wiki</a>. Most calls have the same basic naming convention, categoryMethod, leaving off the get. Check source for exact name for the call you want to make.</p>
		<p>Here is the syntax to make a call for the latest listen to tracks.</p>
<pre>$lastfm->userRecent();</pre>
		<p>Since version 0.4, all methods pass back an array, so you need to capture this in a variable.</p>
<pre>$tracks = $lastfm->userRecent();</pre>
		<p>Most methods return a multi-level array (or array within an array) so to go through the data, you need to use a for or foreach statement.</p>
<pre>
foreach($tracks as $track){
	echo $track->name;
}
</pre>
		<p>Some calls allow for options to be passed. Right now, it doesn't have the greatest implementation, but this will change with the next version.</p>
<pre>$track = $lastfm->userRecent(10)</pre>
		<p>The above code adds a limit parameter, so only 10 tracks are passed back.</p>
<pre>$track = $lastfm->userRecent(10, 7)</pre>
		<p>The above code again, adds a limit and adds a time back parameter declared in days. So this call returns 10 tracks from the past 7 days.</p>
		<p>Here is the problem with passing options back like this.</p>
<pre>$track = $lastfm->userRecent('', 7)</pre>
		<p>If you just want to pass back the time parameter, you have to add a blank parameter for the limit. This will be changing in the next version.</p>
		<p>If you want to know what options each call has, please check the source.</p>

		<p>That is the basic documentation for the Tea-Fueled Last.fm Class. I am in the middle of the next version, so you can expect for some of this to change and for more (and better) documentation, plus examples when I release the next version.</p>
		<p>Thanks for showing interest in this project of mine.</p>
